# Rolemap 🧭

> Daily quests for landing your dream job.

Rolemap is an AI-powered career planning platform that transforms vague career goals into a structured, gamified, and actionable roadmap.

Users select 2–3 target roles (e.g., Software Engineer, Product Manager), rank dream companies, upload their resume, and connect their GitHub. Rolemap analyzes their current skill set, compares it against real hiring expectations, and generates a personalized visual roadmap with daily and weekly tasks.

Instead of “set it and forget it” career goals, Rolemap builds systems for consistent progress.

- Analyzing where you are now (Resume Parsing + GitHub)
- Comparing your skills to real job expectations
